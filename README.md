# concurrentjs
Bring concurrency to the web. Perform JavaScript tasks in parallel on the browser.  

## The Idea
The idea is to create a tool, or a system or a library that can facilitate concurrent programming in JavaScript on the web. I'm not really certain what it would be particullarly. It would help perfom most of the JavaScript blocking tasks in our applications. if possible, could help reduce page sluggish and unresponsiveness affecting user experience on websites or web apps. It seems not really needed or neccessary at the moment though, I want to try it anyways.
